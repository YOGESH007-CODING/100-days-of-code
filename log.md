**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I have done 2 DSA question one from leetcode(medium) and one from coding ninja(medium). Also gave Codeforces Contest for the first time.
**Thoughts**: In my opinion I need to divide me time more effectively, such that I could be able to do both DSA and Web Dev.(with one another).Also want to Start AI ML from July but know i won't be very feasible due to such a heavy and hectic work load.
**Today little task**: Make linkdin profile photo and write about section of your linkdin account.
